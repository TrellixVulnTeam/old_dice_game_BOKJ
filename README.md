# About the Game

Pig game is a simple dice game that is typically played by several players. All players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, as they roll the points are added resulting in a total value, however their gained score is lost for the turn if they roll a 1.
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold", when they decide to hold, the score remains until teir next turn. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player who gaines 100 or more points wins.

Example of a situation:
Two players Adam and Simon play pig game. Adam rolls four times and gets a 5-4-6-2 and on the fifth round he decides to hold. Now his score is 17. Simon rolls 6-3-1. After this round Simon has 0 points.
